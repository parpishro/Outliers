# Introduction to Outliers {.smaller}

- **Outliers:** Data points significantly different from the majority
- **Importance:** Identifying outliers is crucial for accurate data analysis
- **Focus:** We'll explore their impact in regression analysis

# Why Should We Care About Outliers? {.smaller}

- **Impact:** Dramatically influence regression results
- **Insight vs. Noise:** Can be insightful or misleading
- **Goal:** Make more accurate predictions and interpretations

# Spotting the Unusual {.smaller}

- **Leverage:** Potential to influence the analysis
- **Influence:** Not all outliers affect the analysis equally
- **Example:** How outliers can affect the slope of a regression line

# Leverage: The Power to Influence {.smaller}

- **Definition:** Measure of an outlier's potential impact
- **Distance from Mean:** Points farther from the mean have higher leverage
- **Analogy:** Influence in group decisions

# Residuals and Cook's Distance {.smaller}

- **Residuals:** Difference between observed and predicted values
- **Cook's Distance:** Quantifies the influence of an observation
- **Analogy:** Effect of removing one puzzle piece

# Analyzing the Effects {.smaller}

- **Visualization:** How adding/removing outliers affects the regression line
- **Importance:** Visualization aids understanding of outliers' effects

# What to Do with Outliers {.smaller}

- **Decision:** Whether to keep or remove outliers
- **Risk:** Over-simplifying the model by excluding outliers
- **Approach:** Consider source and context

# Conclusion {.smaller}

- **Critical Role:** Outliers in statistical analysis
- **Opportunity:** For deeper understanding, not just errors to remove
- **Insight:** Thoughtful analysis leads to robust models
